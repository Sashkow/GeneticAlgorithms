make algorithm progress
	- test iterate
		- find cases when algorithm converges reliably
		- find space of parameters that lead to reliable convergence
		- ask hulayeva
	- make operator dna as dict dna with operator genes
	- make nk-network as dict dna with boolean functions and links as genes


























add functions as genes

- do i need to generate new sequences?
- is a data an initial state?

fitness function
 
 e.g.
 	add(x).add(x).front() is a sequence of events for circular queue
 		it generates 2 different states: (len=1; rear=0; front=0) and (len=2; rear=1; front=0). 

 The events that modify the data states, called sensitive: add(x)
 the events that do not modify the states, called insensitive: front()


The fitness function has to:
 feature minimizing the number of sequences in the population
 save sequences with unique states

- does fitness function have to be constant?
 
2 types of redundancies: 
	redundant sequence (i.e. duplicate sequences or sequence is subset from another)
	redundant states in the sequence (i.e. such as adding to full queue or removing from empty queue). 

type she fitness function has to be applicable for all case studies.
